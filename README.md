# Nobullz Unity Game Boilerplate

This boilerplate acts as a starting point for prototyping 2D games by providing a working code base without distractions.

## Basic structure

The boilerplate consists of three scenes: a main scene, which acts as the entry point, a menu scene and a game scene. Each scene has its own state, a main state, a menu state and a game state. There are buttons to jump between the menu and the game scene, but apart from that, there's not much going on.

It comes with the following basic tools:
- Game object pool
- Scene loader
- Screen fader
- Messaging system
- Sound manager
- Music manager
- Savegame manager
- Background image
- Debugging helpers
- And a bunch of lose code snippets and helper functions

## Dependencies

- [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) version 2018.3.7f1 or higher

## How to use

You can find a tiny, stripped down example project [here](https://github.com/grumpypixel/Nobullz-Unity-Game-Example).

## Side notes

This is basically the code I use to build prototypes of games. Most parts of the code in this boilerplate have already made it into production in the past, like [here](https://frozenyocode.com) and [here](https://www.giantbomb.com/jingo-jango/3030-48769/).
